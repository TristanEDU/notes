##My questions
###1. Proposal for the job with David, was it well structured and how can I improve.
- git rid of the hey David,
- get rid of the intro with hey I am tristan...
- if the client says offer then they are smarter then average and generally talking about a service
- he does not want a landing page he wants a sales funnel
- landing page, purchase page, upsell page... (2 to 3 pages)
