#Freelanc call with Nathen on 5/9/25
##My questions
###1. Proposal for the job with David, was it well structured and how can I improve.

###2. Proposal for Statewide non-profit, How should I go about it? [this is the job link](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~021919849796804135174)

###3. Negotiations with Conrad Stone. I am meeting with him on tuesday morning and I was hoping for some input based on how the conversation went in UpWork.
