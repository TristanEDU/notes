##Configurator
###Options
1. WP Configurator
	- It is a naitive Wordpress pluging and has a lot of customisation. It costs around $80 to $120 a year depending on wether or not there is conditional logic involved...
	- [WP Configurator Demo Gallery](https://demos.wpconfigurator.com/)
	- [WP Configurator Pro Overview](https://wpconfigurator.com/pro/)
	- [WP Configurator custom logic overview](https://wpconfigurator.com/products/conditional-logic/)
2. STAGGS Pro Configurator
	- It is also a great option costing around $60 a year. The user interface is a little simpler and user friendlier in my opinion but it offer less customization.
