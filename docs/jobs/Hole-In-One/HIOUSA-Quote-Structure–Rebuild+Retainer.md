title: HIOUSA Quote Structure – Rebuild + Retainer
---

## Purpose
To define the final internal pricing and packaging strategy for quoting the HIOUSA.com rebuild and ongoing support retainer.

## Rebuild Quote (One-Time Project)
**Flat Rate:** $2,400 – $3,000

**Included Scope:**
- New site build using Elementor on fresh WordPress install
- Full migration of content and visual replication (with optional modernization)
- Retain Quick Quotes component as-is (integration is external and out-of-scope)
- Responsive, fast, and stable site build
- Accessibility and performance best practices
- No SEO services offered beyond standard best practices (clean HTML, semantic structure, readable layout)

## Retainer Quote (Ongoing Support)
See: [hiousa-retainer-model.md](./hiousa-retainer-model.md)

### Add-On Strategy
- Offer a 10% discount on rebuild if client commits to a 3-month retainer (any tier)
- This provides an incentive to move into long-term partnership without pressure

## Upsell Positioning
- Support across Odds On Promotions blog (currently dated, visually inconsistent)
- Divi site launch assistance for HIOI
- Documented backup, plugin testing, content expansion, responsive tuning

## Internal Notes
- Keep retainer hours generous to ensure perceived value
- Never refer to this as SEO work — only structural best practices
- Premium tier should match or exceed the rebuild quality standard

## Questions (Open)
- Does the client prefer flat rate or would milestone-based billing be more appropriate?
- Should we require a discovery deposit before rebuild begins?
