title: HIOUSA Rebuild – Strategic Overview
---

## Purpose
This note outlines the high-level goals and overall project rationale for rebuilding the HIOUSA.com website and establishing a long-term development partnership with Prize Indemnity Holdings (PIH) across multiple brand sites.

## Objective
To rebuild HIOUSA.com from scratch and create a technical relationship structure that includes multi-tiered retainer options for long-term support and brand-wide digital stability.

## Project Scope Summary
- Rebuild HIOUSA.com using Elementor on a clean WordPress install
- Modernize the visual design where possible, if approved by the client
- Decommission existing site entirely (too clunky and unstable for updates)
- Preserve Quick Quotes integration placeholder (Amazon backend system, out-of-scope)
- Align with Amy Fanter and David Bebout’s internal workflow (WP Engine + staged environments)
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness, clean architecture, and maintainability

## Strategic Rationale
- Existing site is built with legacy themes (Flat Bootstrap) and overloaded plugins
- Custom code and offshore development have introduced stability issues
- Frequent disappearing CSS files after cache clears and plugin updates
- Better long-term ROI comes from rebuilding on a clean foundation than continually patching

## Long-Term Objective
This rebuild is designed to:
- Establish a working rhythm with Amy (marketing) and David (IT)
- Prove value and reliability as a U.S.-based partner
- Expand into supporting HIOI (Divi-based) and Odds On (blog cleanup)

## Questions (Open)
- When will Amy want to start the retainer — during or after rebuild?
- How much future support will Quick Quotes require (i.e. future scope?)
