title: HIOUSA Retainer Model – Internal Plan
---

## Purpose
To define a sustainable, client-friendly retainer structure for supporting HIOUSA.com, HIOI, and Odds On Promotions after the initial rebuild project is complete.

## Retainer Philosophy
- Retainers are structured as fixed 3-month blocks
- Clients receive a 10% discount on Standard and Premium tiers with a 6-month commitment
- Designed for flexibility, scalability, and long-term client retention
- Hours are intentionally over-delivered relative to cost to encourage client buy-in
- Anchored at psychologically comfortable price points ($375 / $700 / $1200)
- Effective hourly rate ranges from $35–$40/hr

## Retainer Tiers
| Tier     | Monthly Fee | Hours Included | Effective Rate | Best For                                            |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic    | $375        | 10 hrs         | $37.50/hr      | Light maintenance, plugin updates, content tweaks   |
| Standard | $700        | 20 hrs         | $35.00/hr      | Ongoing work across brands, layout updates, testing |
| Premium  | $1,200      | 30 hrs         | $40.00/hr      | Heavy dev cycles, Divi site rollout, rapid response |

## All Tiers Include
- Plugin/theme/WordPress updates
- Page edits, layout changes
- Bug fixes, troubleshooting
- WP Engine staging site usage
