## 🗣️ Key Talking Points

- The existing HIOUSA.com site is bloated and unstable due to both technical debt and legacy practices, and it provides a strong use case for not only a rebuild, but also proactive planning for future upgrades and support across their entire web presence:
  - Legacy theme and deprecated plugins
  - Offshore devs modifying PHP instead of using plugin-based solutions
- Attempting to fix piecemeal would be more time-consuming and fragile than rebuilding
- Elementor provides a clean, client-friendly interface and simplifies future updates
- Everything built is fully transferred to HOI once payment is completed — no lock-in

### Retainer Benefits
- Predictable support with fast turnaround
- No more ad hoc dev searches
- Can support not only HIOUSA, but HIOI (Divi) and Odds On (WordPress blog)
- 3-month minimum; 6-month = 10% discount on Standard/Premium tiers

---

## 🧰 Optional Visual Aids

Prepare to screen-share or reference:
- Plugin list from current HIOUSA site (show legacy issues)
- Example clean Elementor-based build (reference site or layout)
- Retainer tier chart (Basic / Standard / Premium)

---

## 📤 Follow-up Deliverables (Post-Call)

- Proposal (Upwork message or branded PDF)
- Payment request: rebuild milestone or bundled offer
- Onboarding email requesting:
  - WP Engine access
  - WordPress admin credentials
  - Staging details

---

**Acceptable Outcome:**
