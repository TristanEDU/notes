## 📄 Proposal for Rebuilding HIOUSA.com + Ongoing Support Retainer

Hi Amy,

Thanks again for the great conversation — I’ve had a chance to look more deeply into the current HIOUSA.com setup, and I’d like to formally propose a clean rebuild combined with a retainer model that gives you ongoing stability, faster support, and full control.

### 🔧 Phase 1: HIOUSA.com Rebuild

**Project Scope:**
- Rebuild the entire site from scratch on a clean WordPress install using **Elementor**
- Maintain existing layout/branding, with optional modernization if desired
- Migrate content and structure into a clean, responsive theme
- Integrate Quick Quotes as a placeholder (no changes to AWS backend)
- Deliver a fast, secure, and stable site on WP Engine’s infrastructure
- Apply performance and accessibility best practices

**Timeline:** ~2–3 weeks  
**Ownership:** All assets and code transfer fully to you upon payment  
**Flat Rate:** $2,400 – $3,000

### 🔄 Phase 2: Ongoing Retainer (Optional but Recommended)

| Tier       | Monthly Fee | Hours Included | Notes |
|------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **Basic**  | $375        | 10 hrs         | Light maintenance, plugin updates |
| **Standard** | $700      | 20 hrs         | Page updates, light design/dev, multi-site coverage |
| **Premium**  | $1,200    | 30 hrs         | Priority access, Divi build support, content overhauls |

**Benefits:**
- WP updates and plugin maintenance
- Staging site support (via WP Engine)
- Layout, copy, and content changes
- Priority response and availability
- Premium includes planning calls and 10% rollover of unused time

### 💡 Bundle Offer

If you commit to any retainer tier for **3 months**, I’ll apply a **10% discount to the rebuild cost**.

**Subject:** Next Steps: HIOUSA.com Rebuild + Support Plan

Hi Amy,

It was a pleasure speaking with you — I really appreciate the time and the clear insight you provided on your team’s needs across HIOUSA, HIOI, and Odds On.

As discussed, I recommend we move forward with a clean rebuild of the HIOUSA.com site, paired with a retainer structure that gives you peace of mind and ongoing flexibility. I’ve outlined everything in the attached proposal, including scope, pricing, and a bundling option if you’re open to a 3-month retainer commitment.

### ✅ Next Steps

To get started, here’s what I’ll need from you:

1. **Access**
   - WordPress admin login (or temp admin account)
   - WP Engine staging/dev access (or credentials via your IT contact)

2. **Decision on Retainer**
   - Let me know if you’d like to bundle the rebuild with a retainer tier (Basic, Standard, or Premium)
   - If yes, you’ll receive a 10% discount on the rebuild total

3. **Kickoff**
   - Once confirmed, I’ll request the 50% project deposit via Upwork (or send a separate invoice if preferred)
   - I’ll begin setup in a staging environment and loop in Dave as needed

Let me know if you have any questions at all — I’m happy to adjust timelines or clarify anything in the proposal.

Looking forward to getting started and supporting you moving forward!
