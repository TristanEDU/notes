#### WordPress Project Notes – HIOUSA.com

**Current Goal:**
Diagnose and resolve recurring CSS file loss after updates/caching events. Primary issue occurs unpredictably and results in homepage format loss.

**Key Dates:**
- Last known good backup: **April 23, 2025**
- Initial contact call and scope meeting: **May 7, 2025**

**People Involved:**
- Amy Fanter (Marketing Lead): ../assets/Amy-Fanter.md
- David Bebout (IT Director): Oversees server, staging, and access

**Platform Context:**
- Hosted on **WP Engine**
- Multiple environments: Production, Staging, Development
- Staging/Dev used for Quick Quotes integration testing
- Quick Quotes uses Amazon-based quoting API but is out-of-scope for current fix
- Theme in use is **SiteOrigin**, but a future site (in Divi) is under construction

**Challenges:**
- Previous devs made backend PHP edits (likely Google Fonts, custom cache layers)
- Frequent plugin updates triggering cascade failures
- Potential corrupted theme/customizer logic

**Short-Term Action Items:**
1. Access WP Engine and WordPress admin
2. Analyze root cause of CSS file loss
3. Provide quote and recommendation (by mid-next week)
4. Maintain formatting during active golf season

**Long-Term Opportunities:**
- Assist with new Hole In One International site (Divi-based)
- Clean up and modernize Odds On Promotions WordPress blog
- Ongoing maintenance and optimization
