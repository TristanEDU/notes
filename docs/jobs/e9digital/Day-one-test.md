### **Question 4**

**Prompt:** Explain how GHL's pipeline and opportunity stages work. How would you use them to track and manage a lead's journey from first contact to closed sale?

**Your Answer:**\
When a client is put into the pipeline either manually or as a result of an automation, they are moved along based on further interactions and actions.

- Optionally use GHL WordPress plugin for easier embed management

### **Question 7**

### **Question 9**

Tags can indicate the purpose or status of a contact. Example: cold leads, or high-priority leads.

---
