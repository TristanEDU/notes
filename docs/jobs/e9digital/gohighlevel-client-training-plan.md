#### Marketing Attribution Models
- 📖 [Marketing Attribution Guide – NoGood](https://nogood.io/2024/08/07/marketing-attribution/)
	- Marketing attribution is what helps marketers and bussiness understand how and what contributed to a given sale and their sales in general. This allows them to fine tune their marketing stratigies
	- It also helps them see how their marketing efforts contribute to the main goals of the company
	- some of the key roles are:
		- Aligning sales and marketing: 59% of businesses believe that aligning sales and marketing is the primary goal of marketing attribution. This is because attribution helps determine the influence of multiple marketing and sales activities across the customer journey and defines credit at each touchpoint.
		- Optimizing marketing spend: This helps the company understand where they should point their marketing buget.
		- Enhancing Customer Experience: this helps them understand the marketing journey and when and where to place key touch points
		- Mearuring ROI
	- Types of Attribution Data:
		- Software based data relies on digital metrics and touch points to monitor user interaction this can be really granular and detailed but will also miss a lot of non digital indicators
		- Self Reported Data is the data that the consumer reports generaly in the form of surveys or questionairs. This data is very usfull as it can provide insitght into what the customer thinks effected him or her and also non digital indicators such as word-of-mouth and phisical advertisment. It is howver in general very inaccurate due to bias's and other factors.
		- Hybrid Data is a mix of the two previous catagories. leading to grater acuracy and scope however it can be very diffacult to implement this well.
	- Single Touch atribution models:
		- First Touch: is where the first interaction a customer has with your marketing (*such as visiting your website or clicking on a facebook post*) is given 100% of the credit for the conversion. This is great for identifying which channesl lead to the most brand awarness however they to not take any of the middle or final steps into acount which can be detrimental if the first step is not the crucial one in the customer journey
		- Last Touch: Considers only the last interaction of the user befor the conversion which is good for understanding how to push users over the edge on converting however if it is soley used it can lead to short sighted ness and missing brandawarness opportunities as it does not account for any of the leadup steps...
	- Multi Touch attribution models:
		- Linear Touch: Gives equal credit to all the steps in a customer journey for the conversion. This is good for getting a clear view of how the costomer interacted but can be faulty if it has incomplete information suchas the use of multiple devices and it does not take into account how things like seasonal channeles affect things.
		- Time Decay: This gives more weight to a touch point the closer it is in the journey to the conversion. It is prone to issues due to the fact that it does not consider the affect of the initial efforts and is generaly only good for B2B marketing.
		- U Shaped model: This gives 40% to the first and last touch point and then spreads the other 20% between the middle points. It is usfule if you want to see specific touchpoints while still haveing a overveiw of the situation. Most commonly it is used for e-commerce metrics such as ROAS and CLV...
		- W shaped model: is simaler to U shaped but it also focus on a middle point as well. It is generaly most usful in a B2B setting with well defined funnels that are easy to calculate. In most cases it is just to cumbersome and diffacult to set up as well as being to complicated to operate.
	- Data Driven Attribution:
		- Data driven models use machien learning and predictive analytics to decide which are the most valuble touchpoints, the algorithim determins which framework is best. This is very valuble for complex customer journeys witha a lot of touch points however due to the complexity and cost to opperate they are genealy only practical for companies with large bugets.
	- Custom Attribution:
		- Custom attribution allos a company to make up it's own rules about which touch points get credit. This is good for complex or abnormal marketing stratigies that other models have a hard time capturing but due the the complexity and cost of setting up and maintianing such a system it is only generaly practical companys with the budget and direct need for such a system.
