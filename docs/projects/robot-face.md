- I am trying to position the element with the class of ".robot-hair-style" on top of ".robot-face-shape" the image below shows what it is now. I beleive the best way to do this is to use a relitive position but I am wondering how you can get it right without trial and error... I feel that there should be a way to acomplish this without that. ![Robot face befor hair is moved](../docs/assets/Robot-face-pre-hair-positioned.png)
